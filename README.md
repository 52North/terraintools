# 52°North TerrainTools
README file for the [52°North TerrainTools library][1]

52°North TerrainTools supports the development of interactive Web based virtual terrain scenes.

TerrainTools makes use of the existing 52°North Triturus module and shall offer various 
tools for interactive terrain model display and analysis. TerrainTools will offer scene export facilities for scene descriptions as X3DOM. 

The framework evolves during the Google Summer of Code 2016 program (participating organizations in this project: Bochum University of Applied Sciences and 52°North). 

## Basic functionality:
* visualize virtual terrain models
* analysis functions like flooding scenario
* ... 

## Characteristics
* Development platform: Java (Windows and Linux/Unix)

## Development goals
The community's vision is to establish a creative surrounding, which allows efficient and intuitive terrain modeling and analysization.
